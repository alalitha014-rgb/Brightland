#How This Project Was Solved / Implemented

The entire UI was built using a single reusable React functional component (App) to maintain simplicity and clarity.

Inline CSS styling was used throughout the project to avoid external CSS dependencies and ensure fast styling control.

The layout was structured using Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve full responsiveness across all screen sizes.

Reusable JavaScript .map() functions were used to dynamically render navigation items, solution cards, platform cards, and footer links.

Hover interactions were handled using onMouseOver and onMouseOut for smooth user feedback without external libraries.

Icons and visuals were added using SVGs and external icon CDN images to enhance UI clarity and user experience.

The project was structured in logical UI sections: Navbar → Hero → Trusted Brands → Solutions → Platforms → Security → Why Choose → CTA → Footer.
